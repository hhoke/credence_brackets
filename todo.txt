first off: find some quick and dirty method to do sentiment analysis on sentence level.

PDF-to-text conversion is tricky

works in python >=3.4

I now have all the bits I need to try to classify these two toy examples.

Another piece of this is backlink analysis. but that complexity can come later.

My goal will be to figure out what sorts of methods will distinguish the positive citation to Kanwisher 1997 from the negative one, and then test further if I can find something that works.

I want this to be quick and dirty. It doesn't have to be perfect, it just needs to give a good enough guess to be better than wading through hundreds of fucking pages of search results.

Maybe sort by citation count on citing articles?

cite.ai test:
kanwisher 2017: OK, but doesn's show Isabel's paper
another test:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945755/
OBVIOUS bullshit but we see ZERO supporting or opposing, only 50 mentioning
despite titles like 'Critical Review of the Effects of Glyphosate Exposure to the Environment and Humans through the Food Supply Chain'
actually, after looking at that, might be a false positive.

This software is hella weak at picking up pro/con. I bet they're only looking at the citation itself and the surrounding sentence. UI looks slick and they have NSF funding.

## kanwisher prototype
Google Scholar doesn't even list the Gauthier paper as a 'citing' paper
Neither does Web of Science
what the fuuuuuck
'semantic scholar' is decent at this, they have the 'highly impacted' setting which is a START.
OK so ranking so far:
Semantic Scholar (has 'highly influenced' metric)
Microsoft Academic
Google Scholar ( It's free, and has highest count)
Literal google (it picked up Gauthier papr)
WoS (same as google but not free)
PubMed (only picked up a handful of citations

Microsoft Academic is perhaps the most interesting to me.
It ACTUALLY picks up the Gautihier paper(in general search but *not* in the 'cited' area!), and also captures basically all of the google scholar citations.

Path forward for now: figure out how to use Semantic Scholar's API
