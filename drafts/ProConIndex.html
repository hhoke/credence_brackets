This is more speculative spinoff of fact_checking_scholarly_papers. THe fundamental question is this:
Why is there no tool like Shepard's for science?
Why is there no shepard's-like mapping tool in general?
(citavi looks pretty bitchin tbh https://www1.citavi.com/service/en/docs/citavi_6_writing_a_research_paper.pdf but is not what I want specifically)
Maybe I can start writing a plugin for zotero? I want to develop something to help with writing lit reviews, basically. Zotero is written in js though.
THe idea is to be able to create and visualize an outline or map

This is the best we have, sadly. No way to quantify the relationships.
  shepardization:
  they have a crack team of editor/attorneys that on average catalogs new cases within 72 hours(https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/products/lexis-advance/shepards.page)
  http://blog.cdnsciencepub.com/21st-century-science-overload/ 2.5M new papers every year
  https://www.onelegal.com/blog/top-court-filing-statistics-from-around-the-country/ 84 million cases filed in state trial courts
  most of these are settled
  google scholar gives 328,000 cases in 2017
  204k in 2018
  162k in 2019
  352k in 2016
  350k in 2015

  I can use a westlaw terminal on the 3rd floor. 
  Lexis Uni has shepard's
  Shepard's is an older product, Westlaw's KeyCite highlights slightly different things
  They generally cite statuetes some court cases 
  Social Science Citation Index in Web of Science might be similar
  negative: caution (modification OR refutation)
  procedural law has its own usage 
  unpublished cases are in databases, but are not in the court reporters 
  SHepard's is going to appear in shepard's if it's in Lexis, but treatises are not given a Shepard's report
  law reviews usually have citation (no negative stuff)
  what is being censured by a judge 
  you can lose a case, you can be charged with malpractice

  Bloomberg law has Bcite which is their version. it kind of sucks
  Free Law Project
  HLS has a case law access project (just scanning all of case law and hosting it with an API)
  RavelLaw  
  Table of Authorities which goes BACKWARDS in time
  Westlaw doesn't have positive and they don't have ANalyzed symbol, only negative.
  Westlaw also has a 'Risk of being overruled' symbol which says that your case relies on a case that's subsequently been overruled

  How is this data edited?
  law library journal in hollis.harvard.edu

  notes: there is some kind of review process. Peer review is mostly problematic because of the immense lag times it introduces (https://scirev.org/about/welcome/) , but it is supposedly necessary because most people's fields are incredibly specialized.

  AALL spectrum

  overall, the big spenders in this area are biglaw firms. Uni gets the dregs. This gives me some idea of what the market might be like -- I should target corporate R&amp;D. 

  OK from a business development perspective, what is the market for lexis like? what is the market for Westlaw like?
  Perhaps I could talk to Ben about this. Or perhaps David F Hill IV.
  What is your use of shepard's index like?

  relative size of markets:
  The legal services industry in the United States generated 256.66 billion U.S. dollars in revenue in 2013 https://www.statista.com/topics/2137/legal-services-industry-in-the-us/
   140 billion U.S. dollars of biotech revenue. https://www.statista.com/topics/1634/biotechnology-industry/

   what is the manuscript matcher? Extracts keywords from your title and abstract, searches journals for them.

   says there's an increased entrepreneurial spirit. Less of a pipeline from science to translation, and more a culture of creating startups.

   What does Peter say:

   - problem of translational research 1) making sense of literature for non-experts 2) ascertaining quality 3) getting blindsided
   what role do startups play in this? is traditional R&amp;D winding down?

drug: mechanism, pathway, then drug discovery
ketruda - recent blockbuster cancer immunotherapy drug

PD-1 discovered dozens of years ago at small company called organon.no development budget so it went on the shelf, shcering-plow bought them out, read through everything, shelved, then merck bought THEM, then 20+ years later, new research came out and the head of research thought to dig this stuff out.

one angle is safety - lots of ML

build graphs around items in the corpus flagabble for safety concerns and distance

starting to do the same thing with corpuses of medical records -e.g. medicare prescription records

prescription records vs. outcomes today

natural discontinuity- 16 years delayed of 

literally do mturk on safety and citation efforts - they get all the red-flags

lots of free text (instead of tagged databases)

clinical trials.gov is a good resource to spot synergies but also failures.

drug companieshave agreed to publish their failures

86% fails to advance in the pipeline

ket

NEC labs -- Peter worked for them in the late 90s

working in parallel to google for the early google stuff

one of the things they had was 

CiteSeer

remaining question -- how is academic research treated?

started to notice like-minded sites with no actual connection

Spotted terrorist sites, called the FBI

profs working from princeton, stanford

Matt Miller

how do they get these failures disseminated? Usually happens in basic research

later-stage research, the investors get involved. obliged to publish results due to legal strictures surrounding trial funding

send a gmail reminder, devops regularoty

broken label printer IQ OQ incident 
every single step had to be documented with a pen-and-paper signature

constantly look for synergies in research, cut deals with labs and hospitals all over the place

wrote meaningful use stuff for Obama
worked evaluating startups
running his own startup: mental health for teens.
service to immediately intake someone who reaches out to them on any channel
it's not all or nothing -- gradual

I should ask Jake about what the CS basic research-to-application ecosystem is like
He reads arXiv 10 hours a week. I think for him he could be a potential customer 
 
Yashi at GS mostly talks to clients or reads his own team's research. Does not foray in to the literature.

Just talked with Justin T Riley MD
"I'm more of an engineer than a scientist. I'd rather build something that actually helps someone or has some real-world impact than publish a paper"

skims abstracts from 'google scholar recommends'
if he sees something good, will drop it in the slack and say 'We should read this'

thinks there's a lot of gamemanship around papers. THere's a ton of investment and delay and opportunity cost represented by papers.
He also thinks most of the field is shit.
He is a proud Reviewer #2. Will give usually enough feedback to qualify him to be added as an author on the paper.
"keep discussion out of results section and keep speculation to the last paragraph of the discussion, if at all"

He prefers to give perspectives rather than reviews.

Much of what he's citing, it's either proof of concept, 'this is a strong paper', or 'this is a paper with a serious weakness/failure'

likes to give talks bc the prep time is less, with more reach.

Doesn't consider himself someone that reads the literature, because most of it doesn't really move the field forward that far.

Randy doesn't really even have a fixed rule, other than that he's constantly reading.

One thing he will do is if hes at a talk and people cite papers, he'll go read them.

He'll also, if he's trying to understand a new field, find a large review paper by a prestigious member of the field and read all the papers they cite.

thinkspot: has pro/con/etc

meta.org
mostly focused around providing people with feeds of new research. Not sure if there's any value-add here tbh

https://f1000.com
Looks to be more or less exactly the product I had in mind.

https://f1000.com/prime/home
this service is basically a curation service run by experts

f1000 workspace: project-focused, basically a more functional mendeley clone. Is it social thought?
https://guides.lib.unc.edu/compare-citation
It's very snappy, and has great integration.

F1000 research is some kind of non-journal journal. It's open access, and you control the review process. Plus, you can create whatever you want, not just articles./Users/hhoke1/Desktop/Screen\ Shot\ 2019-11-17\ at\ 4.16.48\ PM.png
