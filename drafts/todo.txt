That's like 6/20 so 30% which is not terrible.

There's also an issue of being able to actually map out this shit for yourself, when constructing an outline for example.
I would love to show some kind of quantitative display of the utility of credence brackets.
If I have 40 different papers, average of 100 citations per paper, that's 4000 citations to read through and evaluate. 

I could do some kind of reverse-engineering sentiment analysis. I'll break that off into its own project.

I still think coming up with a representative sample of papers would be good and useful for THAT project.

I'm going to abandon a proof-of-concept anyway. The whole point is that for the majority of papers, even a single valence  would be an improvement.
The time it would take to sort through these papers would be simply enormous.
